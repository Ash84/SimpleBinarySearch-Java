# SimpleBinarySearch-Java
Simple binary search demo, in a tab randomly generated, sorted by merge-sort type algorythm.

Compile and launch SearchBinary.java.
First, it launches the test function.
Invokes genRandArray, which generates an array of size "size", and sort it with merge-sort.
Then just tell it which number to look for. If it finds it, it will give you the position, otherwise the program closes.
